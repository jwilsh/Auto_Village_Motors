# 2.0 Prepare

### 2.1 Information on Data Source:
- Data is publicly available on Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data and stored in 18 csv files.
- Generated by respondents from a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 March 2016 to 12 May 2016.
- 30 FitBit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data.
- Data collected includes physical activity recorded in minutes, heart rate, sleep monitoring, daily activity and steps.

### 2.2 Limitations of Data Set:
- Data is collected 5 years ago in 2016. Users’ daily activity, fitness and sleeping habits, diet and food consumption may have changed since then. Data may not be timely or relevant.
- Sample size of 30 FitBit users is not representative of the entire fitness population. The central limit theorem general rule of n≥30 applies and we can use the t test for statstic reference. However, a larger sample size is preferred for the analysis.
- As data is collected in a survey, we are unable to ascertain its integrity or accuracy.
- After further investigation with n_distinct() to check for unique user Id, the set has 33 user data from daily activity, 24 from sleep and only 8 from weight. There are 3 extra users and some users did not record their data for tracking daily activity and sleep.
- For the 8 user data for weight, 5 users manually entered their weight and 3 recorded via a connected wifi device (eg: wifi scale).
- Most data is recorded from Tuesday to Thursday, which may not be comprehensive enough to form an accurate analysis.

### 2.3 Is Data ROCCC?
A good data source is ROCCC which stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited.

Reliable — LOW — Not reliable as it only has 30 respondents

Original — LOW — Third party provider (Amazon Mechanical Turk)

Comprehensive — MED — Parameters match most of Bellabeat products’ parameters

Current — LOW — Data is 5 years old and may not be relevant

Cited — LOW — Data collected from third party, hence unknown

Overall, the dataset is considered bad quality data and it is not recommended to produce business recommendations based on this data.

### 2.4 Data Selection
The following file is selected and copied for analysis.

dailyActivity_merged.csv

### 2.5 Tool
We are using BigQuery in Google Cloud for data cleaning and transformation. Tableau is being used for the visualisations.

# 3.0 Process

### 3.1 Setting-Up the Environement
A new project is created withtin BigQuery whith a relevent title for the project 'bellebeat-capstone-case-study'. We then created a new dataset within the project with the title 'FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data
'.

![Preparing the Environement](https://github.com/jwilsh/Bellabeat_Case_Study/assets/98908958/0e7d8993-7c6e-4e1e-a5a2-45e072718bcd)

### 3.2 Importing the Dataset
The .cvs files from ealrier were uploaded onto this newly created dataset.

### 3.2 Preview the Data and it's Structure
The .cvs files from ealrier were uploaded onto this newly created dataset. Here you can see a preview of the dataset.

![Data Preview 2](https://github.com/jwilsh/Bellabeat_Case_Study/assets/98908958/dae534ce-65a4-4257-bb4a-d56fbeb27647)

You can check the structure of the data in the 'schema' tab.

Information of the data including how many rows it contains in the 'Details' tab.

### 3.3 Data Cleaning and Manipulation
Now that we are familiar with the structure of the data we can clean the data by checking for any errors.

### 3.3.1 Check the number of participants for each data set
Its important to check that the same amount of participants have participated in all of our datasets.
```
SELECT COUNT(distinct Id)
 FROM `bellebeat-capstone-case-study.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.dailyActivity`
```



### 3.3.2 Check Data for null or Missing Values
All columns were checked for Null data or missing values. However none were found.

```
SELECT Id

FROM `bellebeat-capstone-case-study.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.dailyActivity` 

WHERE Id is null
```


### 3.3.2 Check If Correct Datatypes are Applied
Luckily all of the collumns have the correct data type applied so there will be no need to chnage these.

### 3.4 Data Manipulation & Transformation
After checking for dirty data its now time for some data manipultion to get it ready for some analysis. Below are the steps I took in order to transform the data ready to create some visualisations with.

- Create new column DayOfTheWeek by generating date in the form of day of the week for further analysis.

- Create new column TotalMinutes being the sum of VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes and SedentaryMinutes.

- Create new column TotalHours by converting new column TotalMinutes to number of hours.

- Rearrange and rename columns.

```
ALTER TABLE `bellebeat-capstone-case-study.FitBit_Fitness_Tracker_Data.dailyActivity` 
ADD COLUMN DayOfTheWeek DATE;
```
